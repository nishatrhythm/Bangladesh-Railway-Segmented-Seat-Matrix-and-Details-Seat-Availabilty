# Bangladesh Railway Segmented Seat Matrix and Details Seat Availabilty

This repository provides two powerful tools for visualizing and analyzing train seat availability in Bangladesh.

1. **[Segmented Seat Matrix](#segmented-seat-matrix)**  
    Visualize and analyze train seat matrices for different seat types on specific train routes in Bangladesh. It features scripts that fetch seat availability from a public API and **construct segmented travel routes when direct routes are not available**. This tool offers detailed seat information, including VAT.

2. **[Detailed Seat Availability](#detailed-seat-availability)**  
   Fetches and categorizes seat layouts into `Available` or `In Booking Process` groups, organizes seat numbers by prefixes for clarity, and uses color-coded output for enhanced readability.

## Segmented Seat Matrix

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Retrieves seat availability for different train routes and seat types.
- **Seat Matrix Display**: Presents seat matrices for each seat type in a tabular format.
- **Segmented Route Finder**: Calculates and displays alternative travel paths if a direct route is unavailable.
- **Mixed Seat-Type Fallback**: Automatically finds a mixed seat-type segmented route when no full same-type route is available.
- **Detailed Fare Breakdown**: Shows base fare, VAT, service charges, and bedding charges (for specific seat types) for direct and segmented routes.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Menu-driven prompts for ease of use.

## Sample Run

Below is an example of the script running in the terminal:

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Bangladesh-Railway-Segmented-Seat-Matrix-and-Details-Seat-Availabilty.git
   cd Bangladesh-Railway-Segmented-Seat-Matrix-and-Details-Seat-Availabilty
   ```
2. **Install required Python packages:** Ensure you have the required Python packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests tabulate colorama
   ```

## Usage

1. **Modify the script:**
   - You need to update the `target_train_model` and `date_of_journey` variables in the `seatMatrixWithSegmentation.py` script to match your desired train model and date.

   ```python
   token = 'your_token_here'  # Replace with your authorization token
   target_train_model = "781"  # This can be set to match the desired train model
   date_of_journey = "15-Nov-2024"  # This can be modified as needed
   ```

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python seatMatrixWithSegmentation.py
   ```
3. **Menu Options:**
   - Select **1** to check seat availability and enter origin and destination stations.
   - Select **2** to exit the program.
4. **Output Details:**
   - Displays seat matrices for each seat type if seats are available.
   - Shows direct routes with a breakdown of base fare and VAT.
   - Finds and displays segmented routes if a direct route is not available.
   - Displays mixed seat-type segmented routes as fallback when same-type routes are not available.
   - Clearly highlights segment dates when journey spans multiple days.
